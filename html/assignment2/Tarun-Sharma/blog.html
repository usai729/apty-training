            <p>We need to be highly Assertive: Communicate clearly so that the other person is not confused<br>
               Pre-Planning is Important <br>
               If we use the word Done, it means the task is 100% completed, and nothing is left <br>
               Own your mistakes<br>
               Be clear, confident and others should understand what we are speaking
            </p>
            <br>
            <aside>If there's no solution for the problem client is asking, hear their requirement, acknowledge, explain the process of requesting new features to be added (with this we answered and calmed down the client), talk with internal team on weekly meeting to discuss if the solution is possible. End the discussion by sending an email of the outcome. (But what if we lose a big customer in this process)</aside>

               Observe the other person's body language <br>

            <p title="this is a paragraph">Paraphrasing is important as it reassures the requirement which customer has asked, it makes the client understand that we listened and understood the requirement. Also, writing minutes of meeting helps.</p>
