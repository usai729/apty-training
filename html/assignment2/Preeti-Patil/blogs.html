          <p>
            I ask them to take a poem and hold it up to the light like a color
            slide or press an ear against its hive. I say drop a mouse into a
            poem and watch him probe his way out, or walk inside the poem’s room
            and feel the walls for a light switch.I Continue reading

            When some people talk about moneyThey speak as if it were a

            makes me nostalgicFor the years I lived on coffee and bread,Hungry
            all the time, walking to work on paydayLike a woman journeying for

          <p>
            Thanks for the tree between me & a sniper’s bullet. I don’t know
            what made the grass sway seconds before the Viet Cong raised his
            soundless rifle. Some voice always followed, telling me which foot
            to put down first. Thanks for deflecting the ricochet against that
            anarchy of dusk. I was back in San Francisco … Continue reading
